# Zephyr-Zulip Bridge

[Zulip](https://zulip.com) is an open-source team collaboration tool, that was
presumably based on some of the ideas of [Zephyr](http://zephyr-im.org/).  This
repo is a fork of zulip, (eventually) building on tabbott and others' changes
to make it act as a Zephyr client, of sorts.

Zulip is distributed under the
[Apache 2.0](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/main/LICENSE) license.
